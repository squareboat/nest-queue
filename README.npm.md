<div align="center"><strong>Easily integrate queue easily inside your nestjs applications</strong></div>

## Introduction
Queues are a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in backend architecture. They can be used to decouple or defer heavy weight processing such as sending Mails, processing large database operations etc. Messages are kept in queue until processed. Seperating these heavy time consuming tasks drastically improves your response.

Above all, you can easily perform the processing of the messages on the distributed system without causing any workload spike on your consumer-facing server ever again.

__Supported Queues__

- Sync
- AWS SQS
- Redis (Coming Soon)
- RabbitMQ (Coming Soon)

__Few Hightlights__

- ✅ Easy to setup and configure
- ✅ Handle multiple queues with ease
- ✅ Harnesses the powerful DI system by NestJS for creating jobs
- ✅ Configurable messages, queues and jobs
